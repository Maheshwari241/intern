ðŸŽ¯ Interview Questions and Answers
1. What is a view?
A view is a virtual table created using a SQL SELECT query. It doesn't store data itself but presents data from one or more tables.

2. Can we update data through a view?
Yes, but:

The view must be updatable

Should not have aggregates, joins, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, or subqueries

3. What is a materialized view?
Materialized View stores physical data (not just a virtual table). Needs to be refreshed manually or automatically. 
Not supported in SQLite/MySQL (commonly in Oracle/PostgreSQL).

4. Difference between View and Table?
View	                    Table
Virtual table	         Physical storage
No data stored	        Stores data
Created with SELECT	    Created with CREATE TABLE

5. How to drop a view?

DROP VIEW ViewName;

6. Why use views?
Data abstraction

Simplify complex queries

Improve security by restricting access to sensitive columns

7. Can we create indexed views?
In MySQL: No true support for indexed views

In SQL Server: Yes, but with restrictions (called materialized/indexed views)

8. How to secure data using views?
Restrict columns in the view (e.g., hide salary or password fields)

Grant access only to views, not the base tables

9. What are limitations of views?
Some views are not updatable
Can have performance issues with complex views
Cannot always use indexes efficiently

10. How does WITH CHECK OPTION work?
It ensures that updates through the view do not violate its filter conditions.

Example:

CREATE VIEW DeptIT AS
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT'
WITH CHECK OPTION;
