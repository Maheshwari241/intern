ðŸ’¡ Interview Questions & Answers
1. Difference between INNER and LEFT JOIN?

INNER JOIN: Only matched rows.

LEFT JOIN: All rows from left + matched from right (NULL if no match).

2. What is a FULL OUTER JOIN?

Returns all rows from both tables with NULL where thereâ€™s no match.

3. Can joins be nested?

Yes, you can nest joins using parentheses or CTEs:

SELECT *
FROM (TableA JOIN TableB ON ...) JOIN TableC ON ...
4. How to join more than 2 tables?

Just chain joins:

SELECT *
FROM A
JOIN B ON A.id = B.a_id
JOIN C ON B.id = C.b_id;
5. What is a CROSS JOIN?

Every row in Table A joins with every row in Table B (Cartesian product).

6. What is a NATURAL JOIN?

Joins automatically using columns with the same name. Avoided in practice for clarity.

7. Can you join tables without foreign key?

Yes. Joins can be done on any matching column:

SELECT * FROM A JOIN B ON A.email = B.email;
8. What is a SELF-JOIN?

A table joins with itself:

SELECT A.Name, B.Name
FROM Employees A, Employees B
WHERE A.ManagerID = B.EmployeeID;
9. What causes Cartesian product?

Missing or incorrect JOIN condition.

10. How to optimize joins?

Use indexed columns for joins

Avoid joining large tables unnecessarily

Use only required columns (SELECT col1, col2)

Filter early using WHERE
